    "**Zero-shot classification** in NLP refers to the ability of a model to classify text into categories it has never seen during training. This is a powerful approach because traditional classification models typically require labeled data for each category. Zero-shot models, on the other hand, can generalize their understanding of language to assign text to new, unseen categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot classification is especially useful in rapidly evolving domains, where the categories are constantly changing, or when labeled data is scarce. The model's ability to generalize makes it a valuable tool for many NLP applications."

    "Zero-shot classification uses pre-trained models like BERT or GPT that understand language patterns. These models convert both the input text and labels into vectors and predict the label with the highest similarity. The process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-trained Language Model**: Models like BART, GPT-3, or RoBERTa are trained on large text corpora.\n",
    "2. **Natural Language Prompts**: The model receives prompts for each possible class and assesses similarity.\n",
    "3. **Generalization**: The model can classify new categories not seen during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases** include topic classification, sentiment analysis, and intent detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- No labeled data needed\n",
    "- Flexible for new categories\n",

    "**Challenges**:\n",
    "- Potentially lower accuracy compared to task-specific models\n",
